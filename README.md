# What is wireframing?

Wireframes focus on the placement of elements, navigation flow, and overall user interface structure. It  is a crucial step in the design process, serving as a blueprint or skeletal framework of a website or application.It outlines the basic structure and layout without delving into detailed design elements like colors, fonts, or images.


# The Importance of Wireframing In The Design Process.

1. Identifies Usability Issues:
   - By focusing on the user interface structure, wireframing helps identify potential usability issues early on. This can include navigation problems, information hierarchy issues, and interaction flaws.
  
2. Focuses on Functionality and User Experience:
   - By stripping away visual design elements, wireframes allow designers to concentrate on the functionality and user experience, ensuring the product is intuitive and user-friendly.

3. Enables Easy Modifications:
   - Making changes to a wireframe is quicker and less costly than altering a high-fidelity design or a developed product. This flexibility encourages experimentation and iterative improvement.
  
4. Clarifies Ideas and Concepts:
   - Wireframing helps translate abstract ideas into tangible representations. It allows designers and stakeholders to visualize the layout and structure of a project early in the process.

5. Provides a Clear Layout and Structure:
   - Wireframes provide a clear and simple representation of the layout, allowing designers to plan the content placement and prioritize elements effectively.
  
6. Guides the Design Process:
   - Wireframes act as a guide for subsequent design and development phases, ensuring that the final product aligns with the initial vision and requirements.

7. Facilitates Communication:
   - It serves as a communication tool among team members, clients, and stakeholders, ensuring everyone is on the same page regarding the design and functionality.
  
8. Saves Time and Resources:
   - Early detection of design flaws and usability issues saves time and resources that would be spent on revisions later in the design and development stages.
  


# Key Elements in a Wireframe.

1. Content Placement:
   -  Indicates where text, images, and other content will be positioned.
  
2. Navigation:
   - Shows how users will move through the site or application.

3. Functionality:
   - Outlines key functionalities and interactions.
  
4. Layout Structure:
   - Defines the arrangement of elements on the page.


# Types of Wireframes.
#

# Low Fidelity.

- Low-Fidelity Wireframes
   - Simple sketches or basic digital layouts focusing on overall structure and functionality without detailed design.
   - It is used at the beginning of the project during brainstorming between developers.
  
- High-Fidelity
   - More detailed and refined versions, often closer to the final design, including more specific layout and design elements.
   - It is used as the final product.

# Which Type Is Used?

High fidelity because of the details and visuals present. It used colors, images, fonts and every component is in place.

# Wireframing tools
- There are many tools for wireframing such as:
  1. Adobe XD
  2. sketch
  3. Figma
  4. Axure
 
It is recommended for developers to use Figma as it is free and easy to use. It offers a minimalist designs for those who want to simply the process.
It offers a wide range of resources like dev mode where developers can prototype whilest they are coding. It makes it easier for developers to collaborat.

# Benefits Of Wireframing 

- Clear roadmap: 
  - Wireframes provide a clear roadmap for design and development by establishing the basic structure of a product before detailed design and development. 
- Improved communication: 
  - Wireframes help for seamless cooperation and enhanced communication because all the product stakeholders, designers, and developers have a clear understanding of the project's direction.
- Save resources:
  - Wireframing helps to save up on resources.
- Share and collaborate:
  - Digital wireframes are easier to share and allow you to collaborate. 
- Evaluate effectiveness:
  - Wireframes allow project team members and clients to evaluate overall effectiveness of the page layout against usability best practices.
